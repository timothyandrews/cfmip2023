# Prediction

See slides. In a nutshell, warming of the eastern Pacific with the 2015/16 El-Nino led to increased positive feedbacks, while this was somewhat offset by the subsequent triple dip La Nina, as of Spring 2023 substantial warming of the eastern pacific has been observed and El Nino conditions are forecast to strengthen over 2023-24. The expectation from physical understanding is that this will lead to more positive feedbacks (the pattern effect wane) as more data comes in over coming year(s). What follows ought to be a revising of ECS estimates upwards (using traditional methods that do not account for the pattern effect). Let's see what happens...come back to this in 5-10 years.
